## Course material

All lecture notes are in RMarkdown. It is a good idea to learn by running through the code examples. You can do this in several ways. 

### Run in Binder

Easiest way to run the Jupyter Notebooks is Binder, a free service that allows us to run Jupyter Notebooks in cloud. Simply follow the Binder link at <https://ucla-biostat-200c-2020spring.github.io/schedule.html>. 

### Run locally on your own computer

1. Install the most recent versions of R and RStudio. 

2. Git clone the course material in RStudio: `File` -> `New Project...` -> `Version Control` -> `Git`. Enter `https://github.com/ucla-biostat-200c-2020spring/ucla-biostat-209c-2020spring.github.io.git` in the `Repository URL` and click `Create Project`.
